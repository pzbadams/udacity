## Introduction

In this project a Movie Trailer Website is built using Python where users can see some of my favorite movies and watch the trailers. The data will display through a web browser and allow users to review movie information, poster and trailers.

    Step 1: Download and install python from www.python.org

	Step 3: Open the Python GUI called IDLE.  Please select File and Open.  Then locate and open the entertainment_center.py file.
	Step 4: Select Run from the top menu and choose Run Module.  This will run the program and open a browser with some of my favorite movies.
